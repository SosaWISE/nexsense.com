					<h3>We help you prepare.</h3>

					<span class="about-icons aware"></span>
					<h3>We make sure you’re aware.</h3>
					<p>We want to connect you to your home in ways that make life simpler. Whether you’re 3,000 miles away or just down the hall, the more aware you are and the more responsive your home is, the safer you’ll feel.</p>

				<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 text-center">
					<span class="about-icons know"></span>
					<h3>We put you in the know.</h3>
					<p>From local alerts to national trends, we believe the more our customers know, the better. Facebook, email, Twitter, or a good old-fashioned phone call, when it comes to new risks as well as new opportunities, you’ll hear it from us first.</p>
