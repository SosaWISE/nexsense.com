							<h3><j></j> I have some questions about my account.</h3>
							<div class="faq-question">
								<h4>Where do I send my payment?</h4>
								<div class="faq-answer">
									<p>The majority of the time the best payment avenues are credit/debit cards or EFT.  However if you need to mail us, our address is:</p>
									<p>722 E Technology Ave,<br>Suite 1100 Bldg E<br>Orem, UT 84097</p>

							<div class="faq-question">
								<h4>How do I adjust my contact list?</h4>
								<div class="faq-answer">
									<p>Give one of our professional customer service staff a call.  They’ll verify you are account holder by requesting your verbal passcode.  After we’ve verified your account we’ll be happy to assist you with any changes to your contact list you may need. Give us a call 385-375-8100</p>

							<div class="faq-question">
								<h4>How is a verbal passcode different than my master code?</h4>
								<div class="faq-answer">
									<p>There are several codes involved in the system you are using.  A verbal pass code is the code you’d use to verify you are the account owner and is required for cancelling a false alarm.  This verbal pass code should only be shared with members of the household you trust to act in this capacity.</p>
									<p>The Master User Code is used to control the system as well as setting the other 7 user codes.  The master code is also used to access several system settings and functions that the other seven user codes are restricted from using.</p>

							<div class="faq-question">
								<h4>Is if true I could get a discount from my home owners insurance?</h4>
								<div class="faq-answer">
									<p>When you signed up for a system you received an information folder from Nexsense.  In this folder we included a spot to keep your alarm agreement for quick retrieval.   One of the pages in this folder will have a perforated certificate.  Simply fill this out and give it to your homeowner’s insurance.  If you’re unable to find that folder we’ll be offering that certificate for download from our website.  Some insurances have been known to give up to a 20% discount.</p>
