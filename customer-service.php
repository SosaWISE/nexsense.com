								<h4>Can I move my system equipment myself?</h4>
								<div class="faq-answer">
									<p>Only if you want to move a sensor within your home. Just give us a call at 385.375.8100 and we’ll walk you through the simple process.  </p>
									<p>If you’re moving to a new address, leave your system. It’s tied to your current address and could cause some serious issues if moved. Check out our moving warrant, or contact us at 385.375.8150 or <a href="mailto:support@nexsense.com">support@nexsense.com</a> so we can talk about your options.</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="faq-question">
								<h4>What happens when my security system is triggered?</h4>
								<div class="faq-answer">
									<p>When a sensor is triggered, it sends a signal to the wall panel. The panel then signals the central monitoring station where an operator will attempt to make a contact either through your panel or your emergency contact number. If no one responds or the verbal passcode is not provided, the appropriate emergency contact will be dispatched depending on the sensor triggered.</p>
